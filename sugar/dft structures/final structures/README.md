# Computational structures

### Final structures

The lowest energy structure from each conformational search was then further optimized using wB97X-D4, ma-def2-tzvp cpcm(acetone). DLPNO-CCSD(T1) aug-cc-pvtz cpcm(acetone) energies were calculated on each of these optimized structures. The structures are sorted in each folder by Gibbs free energy (DFT). The title in each *xyz* file contains the energy and gibbs free energy at the DFT level and the energy at the DLPNO-CCSD(T1) level.

`Glc Radicals` the radicals formed after H atom abstraction at each site of methylglucoside. *-ac* indicates the presence of a coordinated acetate molecule.

`Sugars` each of the eight methylpyranosides in their alpha and beta anomeric forms.

`TS` H atom transfer TS to/from methylglucoside indicated as either H atom abstraction by quinuclidine radical cation at the site indicated (haa) or H atom donation by adamantane thiol at C3 (had). *-ac* indicates the presence of a coordinating acetate molecule. *-all* indicates that the TS was to/from methylalloside.

`Misc` contains other structures used in the study that do not fit into one of the above categories:
*ac.xyz* (acetate molecule) *all-ac.xyz* (methylalloside coordinated to an acetate molecule) *glc-ac.xyz* (methylglucoside coordinated to an acetate molecule) *haa-c3-4clbenzoate.xyz* (HAA TS at the C3 position of methylglucoside coordinated to a 4-chlorobenzoate molecule) *ipa-rad.xyz* (isopropanol radical used for isodesmic calculations of BDE) *ipa.xyz* (isopropanol used for isodesmic calculations of BDE) *quinH.xyz* (quinuclidinium) *quinradcat.xyz* (quinuclidinium radical cation) *thiol.xyz* (adamantane thiol) *thiyl.xyz* (adamantane thiyl radical)
