# Computational structures

### Conformational search

Each flexible molecule/transition state was extensively conformationally sampled and optimized. This directory contains relaxed structures as indicated below. Structures were generated using wB97X-D4, ma-def2-tzvp(-f) cpcm(dmso). The title in each *xyz* file contains the energy and gibbs free energy at this level of theory.

`all-ac-confs` conformers of methylalloside coordinated to an acetate molecule

`alpha-sugars-confs` confomers of each alpha-methylpyranoside

`beta-sugar` conformers of each beta-methylpyranoside

`Glc-Ac-confs` confomers of methylglucoside coordinated to an acetate molecule

`glucosde-radicals-confs` conformers of the radical formed at each site after H atom abstraction on methylglucoside. Separated by site and presence an acetate molecule (indicated by -Ac)

`TS-HAA-confs` conformers of the TS for H atom abstraction by quinuclidine radical cation at sites C1-C5 of methylglucoside and C3 of methylalloside.

`TS-HAA-Ac-confs` conformers of the TS for H atom abstraction by quinuclidine radical cation at sites C2-C4 of methylglucoside and C3 of methylalloside with an acetate coordinated

`TS-HAD-confs` conformers of teh TS for H atom donation by adamantane thiol to deliver either methylglucoside(glc) or methylalloside(all) from the corresponding C3 radical
