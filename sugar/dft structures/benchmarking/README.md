# Computational structures

### Benchmarking

Conformers of various structure types were used to benchmark DFAs against CCSD(T) energies. Structures were generated using B3LYP def2-tzvp(-f) cpcm(dmso). The structures are sorted in each folder by CCSD(T) energy. The title in each *xyz* file contains the CCSD(T) energy.

`glu-acetate` conformers of methlyglucoside coordinated to an acetate molecule

`glucose` conformers of alpha-methylglucoside

`haa` conformers for the TS for H atom abstraction by quinuclidine radical cation on methyl glucoside at c3

`haa-ac` conformers for the TS for H atom abstraction by quinuclidine radical cation on methyl glucoside with an acetate coordinated

`had` conformers for the TS for H atom donation by adamantane thiol to C3 radical

`radical` conformers of the radical formed from H atom abstraction of methylglucoside at C3 position

`radical-acetate` conformers of the radical formed from H atom abstraction of methylglucoside at C3 position coordinated to an acetate molecule
